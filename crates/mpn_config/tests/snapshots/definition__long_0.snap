* Default: true

WHEN I WROTE the
following pages,
or rather the
bulk of them, I
lived alone, in
the woods, a
mile from any
neighbor, in a
house which I
had built
myself, on the
shore of Walden
Pond, in
Concord,
Massachusetts,
and earned my
living by the
labor of my
hands only. I
lived there two
years and two
months. At
present I am a
sojourner in
civilized life
again.

I should not
obtrude my
affairs so much
on the notice of
my readers if
very particular
inquiries had
not been made by
my townsmen
concerning my
mode of life,
which some would
call
impertinent,
though they do
not appear to me
at all
impertinent,
but, considering
the
circumstances,
very natural and
pertinent.
